## Project Overview

The Predictor project is designed to:
- Perform data analysis and preprocessing.
- Train a predictive model using machine learning.
- Evaluate the model's performance on test data.
- Generate predictions for new input data.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical data, and scales features.
- **Model Training**: Implements and trains various ML models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.).
- **Evaluation**: Measures model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
- **Visualization**: Plots data trends and model results for insights.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/predictor-project.git
   cd predictor-project
   ```
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Predictor.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to run the code.
3. Modify the code as needed to adapt it to your dataset.
